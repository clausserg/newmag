# newmag
**Description:** This is version 1.0 of the **newmag** code: a new tool for calculating magnetic properties (crystal field parameters, g-factors, magnetic susceptibility, etc.) in f-element complexes from multiconfiguration wavefunction calculations (CASSCF, CASSCF+SOC, etc.). The current version is functional only for the f1 orbital configuration and outputs produced with the ORCA quantum-chemistry package.

Please see [DISCLAIMER](DISCLAIMER.md) for legal and safety information regarding the use of this code.

**Usage:** python newmag.py MyOrcaOutput.out

**Usage example:** python newmag.py ./examples/cerocene_anion_cas17.out
